Error Code: -8901
Error Message: "Pump 1 Failed to Start"
Possible Reason: Electrical fault or thermal overload in Pump 1.
How to Fix: Check power supply, circuit breakers, and motor thermal protection. Restart pump after inspection.

Error Code: -8902
Error Message: "Pump 2 Overcurrent Detected"
Possible Reason: Excessive mechanical load or blockage on Pump 2.
How to Fix: Turn off the pump immediately. Inspect for foreign objects in impeller or blocked discharge line. Clear the blockage and restart.

Error Code: -8903
Error Message: "Pump 3 Status Error"
Possible Reason: Internal motor fault or communication failure with pump controller.
How to Fix: Verify wiring and control panel connections. If error persists, replace pump controller or service motor unit.

Error Code: -8904
Error Message: "Flow Sensor Signal Lost"
Possible Reason: Disconnected sensor cable or failed sensor unit.
How to Fix: Check the wiring and sensor connections. Replace the sensor if damage or corrosion is visible.

Error Code: -8905
Error Message: "Pressure Sensor Out of Range"
Possible Reason: Pressure exceeding sensor limits or sensor calibration drift.
How to Fix: Verify system pressure manually. If true pressure is normal, recalibrate or replace the pressure sensor.

Error Code: -8906
Error Message: "Tank Level Critically Low"
Possible Reason: Fluid in the tank has dropped below safe operation threshold.
How to Fix: Refill tank immediately. Investigate system for leaks or excessive draw-off rate.

Error Code: -8907
Error Message: "Tank Overpressure Condition"
Possible Reason: All pumps active with restricted outflow causing pressure buildup.
How to Fix: Shut down all pumps. Open outlet valves to relieve pressure. Check for flow path restrictions.

Error Code: -8908
Error Message: "Pump 1 Communication Timeout"
Possible Reason: Loss of data from pump controller to monitoring system.
How to Fix: Restart communication gateway. Inspect cable and controller integrity. Ensure network stability.

Error Code: -8909
Error Message: "System Flow Rate Below Threshold"
Possible Reason: One or more pumps underperforming or flow path obstructed.
How to Fix: Verify pump status. Check for clogging or closed valves. Activate backup pumps if necessary.

Error Code: -8910
Error Message: "Unexpected Pressure Drop Detected"
Possible Reason: Leak in piping system or suction-side air ingress.
How to Fix: Inspect pipes and joints for leaks. Check pump suction valves and gaskets for integrity.

Error Code: -8911
Error Message: "Excessive Flow Rate Detected"
Possible Reason: Sensor calibration error or abnormal pump operation.
How to Fix: Recalibrate flow sensor. If pumps are cycling too frequently, investigate load-side demand.

Error Code: -8912
Error Message: "Pump 2 Vibration Exceeds Limit"
Possible Reason: Mechanical imbalance or worn-out bearings.
How to Fix: Shut off the pump. Conduct mechanical inspection. Replace bearings if necessary.

Error Code: -8913
Error Message: "Data Logging Failure"
Possible Reason: Disk write error or disconnected logging interface.
How to Fix: Ensure storage drive is connected and not full. Restart logging service.

Error Code: -8914
Error Message: "UI Display Sync Failure"
Possible Reason: Loss of real-time data stream or buffer overflow.
How to Fix: Restart user interface application. Ensure communication services are running properly.

Error Code: -8915
Error Message: "System Emergency Stop Triggered"
Possible Reason: Manual E-Stop engaged or automatic threshold exceeded.
How to Fix: Inspect system for unsafe condition. Reset E-Stop circuit and verify system integrity before restarting.
